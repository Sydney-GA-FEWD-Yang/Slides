        <h2>Git WAT?</h2>
        <h4>Git is a version control system</h4>
        <p>
            All modern development teams use some sort of version control system (Git, SVN, Mercurial).  Git is extremely popular amongst front-end web developers.

        <h2>Git vs Github</h2>
        <p>Git is the name of the open source software</p>
        <p>Github is the name of a hosting company that uses the Git software</p>
        <p>You can think of Github and Git as the same thing for now</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Git allows multiple users to work on the same codebase (project) and helps track changes.</li>
            <li>Github allows you to store shared code on a cloud server</li>
            <li>Git allows you to revert changes, review changes before they are commited and everything else that a version control system includes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We'll be using Github throughout this course
        </p>
        <small>Fun Fact: Github employees work on an open allocation basis, meaning they can work on any project they like.</small>

        <h2>Git Simplified</h2>
        <p>Think of git as a cloud storage, we'll learn to upload, share and download from this cloud storage</p>
